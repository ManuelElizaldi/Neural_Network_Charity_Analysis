# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 
In this project we use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We created the following to report our results: 

- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimized Model

### Tools
- Python
- Sklearn library
- TensorFlow library
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
