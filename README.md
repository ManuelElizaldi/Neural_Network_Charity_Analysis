# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 
In this project we use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We created the following to report our results: 

- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimized Model

### Tools
- Python
- Sklearn library
- TensorFlow library
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

### Data set
The dataset used can be found in the resources folder

## Results
- The objective of this model is to predict the outcome of the IS_SUCCESSFUL column. 
- The features in the dataset are used to make predictions, including: 
  - APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT
